# Elka_Synthex_Emulator
An HTML canvas based functional emulator of the Elka Synthex syntheziser.

This is a work in progress, but not likely finished soon.

There is no sound. Just the emaulation of the 6502 code of the original synhteziser. There is a CPU monitor and two hardware monitors that can be opened on top of the synth.
